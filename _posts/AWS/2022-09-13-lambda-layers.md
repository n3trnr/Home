## How to add Lambda-Layers
-----
### (This guide is based on Python 3.9 version and Windows PC)
<br>
â€»  Before we begin, please check your python version in your local PC. you can check your python version by this command 
  
  ```
PS C:\Users> pip --version
pip 22.0.4 from C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.9_3.9.3568.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.9)
  ```
<br>
  
-  First, you need to make proper directory to download external library. <br>
    the location should be like this format
    
```
 /your_package_name/python/
```
<br>

-  After you make directory, move to that directory by shell program
<br>

```
cd /your_package_name/python/
```

<br>

-   And now you are ready to download the external library in your local computer 
 
```
 pip install [Package name] -t [your_package_name/python/] --no-user
```
<br>

-   Once you install the package, your package directory should be look like this

  ![lambda_1](/assets/lambda_1.png)

- Move out to your_package_name/ path
```
  cd ../..
```

<br>

- And then, you should zip the directory as its package name. <br>
  (In this example, I used PowerShell script. But if you have another Zip-File maker (ex. Winzip), you can use it )
```
 ##This line works only in PowerShell! 

  Compress-Archive -Path ./[your_package_name] ./[your_package_name].zip
```

<br>

- Now you finished to created package file to upload! Move on to AWS Lambda Console
