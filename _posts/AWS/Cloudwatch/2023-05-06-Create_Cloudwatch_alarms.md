Search EC2 instances by it's ID (which starts with i-) 

**3.** As you can see, you can now choose namespace. If you didnt installed CWAgent, You can only see AWS namespace, however we installed CWAgent so that we can define CWAgent metrics among Custom Namespaces.

**Period** : set as [1 minute] (Check the status in every 1 minutes)
